# GC to PC Chao Converter (WIP)
This is a currently unfinished program that converts broken Fusion Chao Editor .chao files imported from the GameCube version of Sonic Adventure 2 to work properly on the PC version. 
Before, this had to be done by hand with a hex editor, but no more!

**NOTE: I have not tested this program. I will soon and then build an executable when I've confirmed it's working. You can of course build it yourself if you live on the wild side.**

#Usage
* Begin by following [this guide](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=444918749&insideModal=1) until you're done exporting all your corrupted Chao's files from Fusion Chao Editor.
* Run my converter with all .chao files in the same directory as the program.
* Re-import your fixed Chao files over their respective slots in Fusion Chao Editor.
* Have fun with your successfully migrated Chao!
