# GC to PC Chao Converter (WIP)
This is a currently unfinished program that converts broken Fusion Chao Editor .chao files imported from the GameCube version of Sonic Adventure 2 to work properly on the PC version. 
Before, this had to be done by hand with a hex editor, but no more!

**NOTE: The program is currently unfinished. It may work in its current state if you compile it yourself, but I have not tested it, and it only processes one file at a time (which I will soon change). Come back in a day or two and it'll be more complete.

#Usage
* Begin by following [this guide](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=444918749&insideModal=1) until you're done exporting all your corrupted Chao's files from Fusion Chao Editor.
* Use my converter on each of the files.
* Re-import your fixed Chao files over their respective slots in Fusion Chao Editor.
* Have fun with your successfully migrated Chao!
